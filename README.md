# Crowding_VS_features

*under development*

Experiment design and analysis scripts in this repository were developed using python 3.6. It requires certain dependencies, of which the most relevant is [exptools2](https://github.com/VU-Cog-Sci/exptools2) (for communication with the eyetracker). 

To run a session, `cd` into the `experiment` folder and write
`python main.py <sub_num> <ses_type>`
